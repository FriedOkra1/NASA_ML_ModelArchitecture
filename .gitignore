# Keep the structure but ignore content if needed, but for results usually we might want to see them if they are images.
# Actually, the user has many pngs in results, those are fine.
# But I will ignore the models directories which likely contain the binaries I ignored above.

# If the user wants to keep the results images (pngs), I shouldn't ignore the whole results folder.
# I will just rely on the extension ignores for binaries.
